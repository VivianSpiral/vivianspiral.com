It's not often that I encounter an artist who is consistently a 'highlight' of any show that I have produced that she has been a part of. Spiral is one of those types of artists. Not only is she a consummate professional, but she is also a very pleasant person to be around and an artist who is easy to work with. These are all qualities that I seek when selecting performers to be a part of my productions.",

    text: "I include Spiral in the majority of proposals for Variety Shows that I am working on, as I know that she will not only 'deliver the goods' on stage, but she will do so in a positively radiant way, and in the process will enchant and charm the entire audience. I  have used her talents for all kinds of crowds, from all adult Corporate events, to some of the more 'Family' types of shows. I can say that without a doubt, she will amaze and hypnotize people from 9 months to 90 years old. If you want to create a memorable show and one that will amaze, enchant, mesmerize and entertain your audience, then you NEED to book Spiral and make her a part of your show, event, or production.",
